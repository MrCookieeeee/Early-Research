This project is a collaborative effort between the School of Computer Science and the School of Economics and Management. I have written all the code myself. The primary work includes:
Data Cleaning: Cleaning the source data, which is an Excel file containing 46,743 pieces of patent data.
Community Division: Dividing the relevant patent communities.
Main Path Analysis: Using the main path analysis algorithm to extract the main path of patent evolution.
Future Development Prediction: Predicting the future development direction of patents.
