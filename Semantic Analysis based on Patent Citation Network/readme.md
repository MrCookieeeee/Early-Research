1. Data Cleaning: Cleaning the source data, which is an Excel file containing 46,743 pieces of patent data.
2. Community Division: Dividing the relevant patent communities.
3. Main Path Analysis: Using the main path analysis algorithm to extract the main path of patent evolution.
4. Future Development Prediction: Predicting the future development direction of patents.
