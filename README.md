## Scaffolding video surveillance system based on multi-mode
To ensure standardization in scaffolding construction, we have established a scaffolding classification model based on semantic segmentation. We created a dataset of 1000 scaffolding images and employed the SegFormer algorithm to achieve more precise semantic segmentation of scaffolding components.<br />

## Improved federation learning method based on incremental neural network   
In this project, we propose an improved method for the traditional Stochastic Configuration Network (SCN). Our approach replaces the conventional upper triangular matrix decomposition with LU decomposition, enhancing the operational speed and making the network more lightweight. Additionally, we incorporate federated learning into the incremental neural network, utilizing a weighted aggregation algorithm to improve model generalization and safeguard the data privacy of end nodes.<br />
