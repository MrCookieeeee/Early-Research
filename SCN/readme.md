## Improved federation learning method based on incremental neural network
In this project, we propose an improved method for the traditional Stochastic Configuration Network (SCN). 
The contributions are as follows:
1. Replaces the conventional upper triangular matrix decomposition with LU decomposition, thus enhancing the operational speed and making the network more lightweight.
2. Incorporate federated learning into the incremental neural network, utilizing a weighted aggregation algorithm to improve model generalization and safeguard the data privacy of end nodes.

## Results:
Single node training using  LU-SCN <br />
